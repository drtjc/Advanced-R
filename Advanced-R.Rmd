# Names and Values
## Prerequisites
We'll use the development version of lobstr to dig into the memory representation of R objects.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# devtools does not seem to work with R 3.5.0. Below is a work around - see https://github.com/r-lib/devtools/issues/1772
# library(devtools)
# assignInNamespace("version_info", c(devtools:::version_info, list("3.5" = list(version_min = "3.3.0", version_max = "99.99.99", path = "bin"))), "devtools")
# find_rtools()
# devtools::install_github("r-lib/lobstr")
library(lobstr)
```

## Binding basics
Take this code:
```{r}
x <- 1:3
```
It is easy to read this code as: "create an object named 'x', containing the values 1, 2, and 3".
It's more accurate to think about this code as doing two things:

* Creating an object, a vector of values, `1:3`.
* Binding the object to a name, `x`.

Note that the object, or value, doesn't have a name; it's the name that has a value.You can think  of a name as a refence for a value.
For example, if you run this code you don't get another copy of the value `1:3`.

```{r}
x <- 1:3
y <- x
obj_addr(x)
obj_addr(y)
```

As can been seen, both `x` and `y` point to the same location in memory.

```{r, out.width="200px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/binding-2.png")
```

## Exercises
1. Explain the relationsip between `a`, `b`, `c` and `d` in the following code:
```
a <- 1:10
b <- a
c <- b
d <- 1:10
```

`a`, `b` and `c` point to the same value/object; `d` points to a different value/object
```{r, echo = FALSE}
a <- 1:10
b <- a
c <- b
d <- 1:10
```

```{r}
obj_addr(a)
obj_addr(b)
obj_addr(b)
obj_addr(d)
```

2. The following code accesses the mean function in multiple different ways. Do they all point to the same underlying function object? Verify with `lobstr::obj_addr`.
```
mean
base::mean
get("mean")
evalq(mean)
match.fun("mean")
```

Yes, they all point to the same underlying function object.
```{r}
obj_addr(mean)
obj_addr(base::mean)
obj_addr(get("mean"))
obj_addr(evalq(mean))
obj_addr(match.fun("mean"))
```

## Non-syntactic names
A **syntactic** name must consist of letters, digits, `.` and `_`, and can't begin with `_` or a digit. Additionally, it can not be one of a list of  **reserved words** like `TRUE`, `NULL`, `if`, and `function` (see the complete list in `?Reserved`). Names that don't follow these rules are called **non-syntactic** names, and if you try to use them you'll get an error.

```{r, error=TRUE}
_abc <- 1
```

```{r, error=TRUE}
if <- 10
```

It is possible to override the usual rules and use a name with any sequence of characters by surronding the name with backticks:

```{r, error=TRUE}
`_abc` <- 1
print(`_abc`)

`if` <- 10
print(`if`)
```

Typically, you won't deliberately use such crazy names. Instead you need to understand them because you'll be subjected to them by others - this happens most commonly when you load data that has been created outside of R.

## Exercises
1. By default, base R data import functions, like `read.csv()`, will automatically convert non-syntactic names to syntactic names. Why might this be problematic? What option allows you to suppress this behaviour?

2. What rules does `make.names()` use to convert non-syntactic names into syntactic names?

3. Why is .123e1 not a syntactic name? Read `?make.names`.

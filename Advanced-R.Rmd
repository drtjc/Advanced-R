# Names and Values
## Prerequisites
We'll use the development version of lobstr to dig into the memory representation of R objects.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# devtools does not seem to work with R 3.5.0. Below is a work around - see https://github.com/r-lib/devtools/issues/1772
# library(devtools)
# assignInNamespace("version_info", c(devtools:::version_info, list("3.5" = list(version_min = "3.3.0", version_max = "99.99.99", path = "bin"))), "devtools")
# find_rtools()
# devtools::install_github("r-lib/lobstr")
library(lobstr)
```

## Binding basics
Take this code:
```{r}
x <- 1:3
```
It is easy to read this code as: "create an object named 'x', containing the values 1, 2, and 3".
It's more accurate to think about this code as doing two things:

* Creating an object, a vector of values, `1:3`.
* Binding the object to a name, `x`.

Note that the object, or value, doesn't have a name; it's the name that has a value.You can think  of a name as a refence for a value.
For example, if you run this code you don't get another copy of the value `1:3`.

```{r}
x <- 1:3
y <- x
obj_addr(x)
obj_addr(y)
```

As can been seen, both `x` and `y` point to the same location in memory.

```{r, out.width="200px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/binding-2.png")
```

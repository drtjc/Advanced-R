# Names and Values
## Prerequisites
We'll use the development version of the lobstr package and the CRAN pryr package to dig into the memory representation of R objects and to pry back the surface of R and dig into the details.

```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# devtools does not seem to work with R 3.5.0. Below is a work around - see https://github.com/r-lib/devtools/issues/1772
# library(devtools)
# assignInNamespace("version_info", c(devtools:::version_info, list("3.5" = list(version_min = "3.3.0", version_max = "99.99.99", path = "bin"))), "devtools")
# find_rtools()
# devtools::install_github("r-lib/lobstr")
library(lobstr)
# pryr package also provides tools to pry back the surface of R and dig into the details
library(pryr)
```

## Binding basics
Take this code:

```{r}
x <- 1:3
```

It is easy to read this code as: "create an object named 'x', containing the values 1, 2, and 3".
It's more accurate to think about this code as doing two things:

* Creating an object, a vector of values, `1:3`.
* Binding the object to a name, `x`.

Note that the object, or value, doesn't have a name; it's the name that has a value.You can think  of a name as a refence for a value.
For example, if you run this code you don't get another copy of the value `1:3`.

```{r}
x <- 1:3
y <- x
lobstr::obj_addr(x)
lobstr::obj_addr(y)
pryr::address(x)
pryr::address(y)
```

As can been seen, both `x` and `y` point to the same location in memory.

```{r, out.width="200px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/binding-2.png")
```

## Exercises
1. Explain the relationsip between `a`, `b`, `c` and `d` in the following code:  
```
a <- 1:10
b <- a
c <- b
d <- 1:10
```
**A**: `a`, `b` and `c` point to the same value/object; `d` points to a different value/object

    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    a <- 1:10
    b <- a
    c <- b
    d <- 1:10
    ```
    ```{r}
    address(a)
    address(b)
    address(c)
    address(d)
    ```

2. The following code accesses the mean function in multiple different ways. Do they all point to the same underlying function object? Verify with `lobstr::obj_addr`.  
```
mean
base::mean
get("mean")
evalq(mean)
match.fun("mean")
```
**A**: Yes, they all point to the same underlying function object.
    ```{r}
    obj_addr(mean)
    obj_addr(base::mean)
    obj_addr(get("mean"))
    obj_addr(evalq(mean))
    obj_addr(match.fun("mean"))
    ```
    Note that pryr::address doesn't work for function representations 2-5 above:
    ```{r, error = TRUE, results='markup'}
    address(mean)
    address(base::mean)
    address(get("mean"))
    address(evalq(mean))
    address(match.fun("mean"))
    ```    
    However, there is a work around:
    ```{r}
    x1 <- mean
    address(x1)
    x2 <- base::mean
    address(x2)
    x3 <- get("mean")
    address(x3)
    x4 <- evalq(mean)
    address(x4)
    x5 <- match.fun("mean")
    address(x5)
    ```    
    
### Non-syntactic names
A **syntactic** name must consist of letters^[Surprisingly, what consitutes a letter is determined by you current locale. That means that the synax of R code actually differs from computer to computer, and it's possible for a file that works on one computer to not even parse on another!], digits, `.` and `_`, and can't begin with `_`, a digit, or `.` followed by a digit. Additionally, it can not be one of a list of  **reserved words** like `TRUE`, `NULL`, `if`, and `function` (see the complete list in `?Reserved`). Names that don't follow these rules are called **non-syntactic** names, and if you try to use them you'll get an error.

```{r, error=TRUE}
_abc <- 1
```

```{r, error=TRUE}
if <- 10
```

It is possible to override the usual rules and use a name with any sequence of characters by surronding the name with backticks:

```{r, error=TRUE}
`_abc` <- 1
print(`_abc`)

`if` <- 10
print(`if`)
```

Typically, you won't deliberately use such crazy names. Instead you need to understand them because you'll be subjected to them by others - this happens most commonly when you load data that has been created outside of R.

### Exercises
1. By default, base R data import functions, like `read.csv()`, will automatically convert non-syntactic names to syntactic names. Why might this be problematic? What option allows you to suppress this behaviour?  
**A**: This might be especially problematic in non-interactive R usage, when R reads and writes data and the output is expected to contain the same names as used in the data source. Name conversion can be supressed by setting the `check.names` argument to `FALSE`.

2. What rules does `make.names()` use to convert non-syntactic names into syntactic names?  
**A**: The character "X" is prepended if necessary. All invalid characters are translated to ".". A missing value is translated to "NA". Names which match R keywords have a "." appended to them. Duplicated values are altered by `make.unique` if specified.
    ```{r}
    str(make.names)
    ```
    ```{r}
    str(make.unique)
    ```
    ```{r}
    names <- c(".1x", "if", "x!%*", NA, "", ".1x")
    make.names(names)
    make.names(names, unique = TRUE)
    ```
    Note that `NA` is converted to "NA.". That is because it is first converted to "NA", which is an R keyword, so a "." is appended.
    ```{r}
    names <- c("x", "x")
    make.unique(names)
    make.unique(names, sep = "_")
    make.names(names)
    make.names(names, TRUE)
    ```
    

3. Why is `.123e1` not a syntactic name? Read `?make.names`.  
**A**: Because it starts with a `.` followed by a digit. 

## Copy-on-modify
Consider the following code, which binds `x` and `y` to the same underlying value, then modifies `y`.

```{r}
x <- 1:3
y <- x
y[3] <- 4
x
```

While the value associated with `y` changes, the original object does not. Instead, R creates a new object with one value changed, then rebinds `y` to that object.

```{r, out.width="200px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/binding-3.png")
```

This behaivour is called **copy-on-modify**. There are a couple of important exceptions to copy-on-modify - see [Modify-in-place].

### tracemem()
You can see when an object gets copied with the help of `base::tracemem()`.

```{r, results='markup'}
x <- 1:3
str(x)
tracemem(x)
y <- x
y[3] <- 4L
y[3] <- 5L # y is not copied
untracemem(x)
z <- y
z[3] <- 6L
w <- x
w[3] <- 4L # x was not being traced
untracemem(y)
untracemem(z)
z[3] <- 7.5 # z is not being traced. If it were, a copy would occur as z[3] is now numeric, not an integer
str(z)
```

### Function calls
The same rules for copying also apply to function calls. Take this code:

```{r}
f <- function(a) {
  a
}
```
```{r}
x <- 1:3
tracemem(x)
z <- f(x)
z
untracemem(x)
```

While `f()` is running, `a` inside the function will point to the same value as `x` does outside of it:

```{r, out.width="200px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/binding-f1.png")
```

And once complete, `z` will point to the same object.

```{r, out.width="200px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/binding-f2.png")
```

```{r}
address(x)
address(z)
```


If `f()` were to modify `x`, R would create a new copy, and then `z` would bind to that object.

```{r}
f <- function(a) {
  a[3] <- 4L
  a
}
```
```{r, results='markup'}
x <- 1:3
tracemem(x)
z <- f(x)
z
untracemem(x)
```
```{r}
address(x)
address(z)
```

### Lists
It's not just names (i.e. variables) that point to values; the elements of a list do too. Take this list, which is superficially very similar to the vector above:

```{r}
l1 <- list(1, 2, 3)
```

The internal representation of the list is actually quite different to that of a vector. A list is really a vector of references:

```{r, out.width="200px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/list.png")
```

This is particularly important when we modify a list:

```{r}
l2 <- l1
```

```{r, out.width="200px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/l-modify-1.png")
```

```{r}
l2[[3]] <- 4
```

```{r, out.width="200px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/l-modify-2.png")
```

Like vectors, lists are copied-on-modify; the original list is left unchanged, and R creates a modifed copy. Note that the copy is **shallow**: the list object and its bindings are copied, but the values pointed to by the bindings are not.

You can use `lobstr::ref()` to see values that are shared across lists. `ref()` prints the memory address of each object, along with a local id so that you can easily cross-reference shared components.

```{r}
lobstr::ref(l1, l2)
```

Consider this code:

```{r}
l1 <- list(1,2)
l2 <- list(3,4)
l <- list(l1, l2)
lc <- l
lc[[1]][[1]] <- 5
lobstr::ref(l, lc)
```
Or in words:

* List `lc` has a different address from `l` - local ids 1 and 8
* List `lc[[1]]` (i.e. '`l1`') has a different address from `l[[1]]` - local ids 2 and 9
* Dbl `lc[[1]][[1]]` has a different address from `l[[1]][[1]]` - local ids 3 and 10
* Dbl `lc[[1]][[2]]` has the same address as `l[[1]][[2]]` - local id 4
* List `lc[[2]]` (i.e. '`l2`') has the same address as `l[[2]]` - local id 5

### Data frames
Data frames are lists, so copy-on-modify has important consequences when you modify a data frame. Take this data frame as a example:

```{r}
d1 <- data.frame(x = c(1, 5, 6), y = c(2, 4, 3))
```

```{r, out.width="200px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/dataframe.png")
```

# Vectors
Vectors can be organized by their dimension (1d, 2d, nd) and whether they're all homogeneous or heterogeneous. This gives rise to the five types most often used in data analysis:

Dimension     | Homogeneous   | Heterogeneous
------------- | ------------- | -------------
1d            | Atomic vector | List
2d            | Matrix        | Data frame
nd            | Array         |

```{r, echo=FALSE}
d <- c("1d", "2d", "nd")
ho <- c("Atomic vector", "Matrix", "Array")
he <- c("List", "Data frame", "")
dt <- data.frame(Dimension = d, Homogeneous = ho, Heterogeneous = he, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
kable(dt) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("condensed", "hover"), full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```

Note that R has no 0-dimensional, or scalar types. Individual numbers or strings are vectors of length one.

Vectors come in two flavours:

* Atomic vectors
* Lists

```{r, out.width="200px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/summary.png")
```

They have three common properties:

* Type, `typeof()`, what it is.
* Length, `length()` how many elementd it contains.
* Attributes, `attributes()`, additional arbitrary metadata.

All elementd of an atomic vector must be the same type, whereas the elements of a list can have different types.

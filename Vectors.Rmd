# Vectors
Vectors can be organized by their dimension (1d, 2d, nd) and whether they're all homogeneous or heterogeneous. This gives rise to the five types most often used in data analysis:

Dimension     | Homogeneous   | Heterogeneous
------------- | ------------- | -------------
1d            | Atomic vector | List
2d            | Matrix        | Data frame
nd            | Array         |

```{r, echo=FALSE}
d <- c("1d", "2d", "nd")
ho <- c("Atomic vector", "Matrix", "Array")
he <- c("List", "Data frame", "")
dt <- data.frame(Dimension = d, Homogeneous = ho, Heterogeneous = he, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
kable(dt) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("condensed", "hover"), full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```

Note that R has no 0-dimensional, or scalar types. Individual numbers or strings are vectors of length one.

Vectors come in two flavours:

* Atomic vectors
* Lists

```{r, out.width="200px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/summary.png")
```

They have three common properties:

* Type, `typeof()`, what it is.
* Length, `length()` how many elementd it contains.
* Attributes, `attributes()`, additional arbitrary metadata.

All elementd of an atomic vector must be the same type, whereas the elements of a list can have different types.

## Atomic vectors
There are 6 types of atomic vectors:

* Logical
* Integer
* Double
* Character
* Complex - used for complex arithmetic
* Raw - intended to hold raw bytes

```{r}
dbl_var <- c(1, 2.5, 4.5)
int_var <- c(1L, 6L, 10L)
log_var <- c(TRUE, FALSE, T, F)
chr_var <- c("these are","some strings")
```

```{r, out.width="200px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Atomic.png")
```

Atomic vectors are always flat, even if you nest with `c()`'s:

```{r}
c(1, c(2, c(3,4)))
# the same as
c(1, 2, 3, 4)
```

Missing values are specified with `NA`, which is a logical vector of length 1. `NA` will always be coerced to the correct type if used inside `c()`, or you can create `NA`s of the correct type with `NA_real_`, `NA_integer_` and `NA_character_`.

### Types and tests
Given a vector, you can determine its type with `typeof()`.

Use "is" functions with care. `is.character()`, `is.double()`, `is.integer()` and `is.logical()` are ok. The following are surprising:

* `is.vector()` tests for vectors with no attributes apart from names. Use `is.atomic() || is.list()` to test if an object is actually a vector.
* `is.atomic()` tests for atomic vectors or `NULL`.
* `is.numeric()` tests for the numerical-ness of a vector - returns true if the type is an integer or a double, but not a factor. 

```{r}
int_var <- c(1L, 6L, 10L)
typeof(int_var)
```
```{r}
null_var <- NULL
is.atomic(null_var)
typeof(null_var)
```
```{r}
v <- c(x=1, y=2, z=3)
attributes(v)
is.vector(v)
```
```{r}
attr(v, "t") <- "test"
attributes(v)
is.vector(v)
is.atomic(v)
```
```{r}
is.numeric(1)
is.numeric(1L)
is.numeric("1")
```
```{r}
v = c(1,2,2,3,1,2,3,3,1,2,3,3,1)
is.numeric(v)
typeof(v)
class(v)
```
```{r}
fv = factor(v)
fv
is.numeric(fv)
typeof(fv)
class(fv)
```

### Coercion
All elements of an atomic vector must be of the same type  and, if necessary, are coerced to the most flexible one. Types from least to most flexible are: logical, integer, double, character.

```{r}
str(c("a", 1L))
```

When a logical vector is coerced to a numeric, `TRUE` becomes `1` and `FALSE` becomes `0`. This is useful in conjunction with `sum()` and `mean()`.
```{r}
x <- c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
as.numeric(x)

sum(x) # total number of TRUEs
mean(x) # proportion of TRUEs
```

Coercion often occurs automatically. Explicit coercion can be done with `as.character()`, `as.double()`, `as.integer()`, and `as.logical()`. `as.numeric()` is identical to `as.double()`.

## Lists
Lists are different from atomic vectors because their elements can be of any type, including lists.

```{r}
x <- list(1:3, "a", c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), c(2.3, 5.9))
str(x)
```

```{r, out.width="200px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/list1.png")
```

Lists are sometimes called **recursive** vectors because they can contain other lists.

```{r}
x <- list(list(list(list(1))))
str(x)
is.recursive(x)
```

`c()` will combine several lists into one. If given a combination of atomic vectors and lists, `c()` will coerce the vectors to lists before combining them.

```{r}
x <- list(list(1, 2), c(3, 4))
str(x)
```
```{r}
y <- c(list(1, 2), c(3, 4))
str(y)
```

```{r, out.width="200px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/list-c.png")
```

The `typeof()` a list is list. You can test for a list with `is.list()` and coerce to a list with `as.list()`. You can turn a list into an atomic vector with `unlist()`. If the elements of a list have different types, `unlist()` uses the same coercion rules as `c()`.

```{r}
x <- list(list(1, 2), c("a", "b"))
typeof(x)
is.list(x)
str(unlist(x))
```

## `NULL`
`NULL` is a singleton object often used to represent a vector of length 0.

```{r}
typeof(NULL)
length(NULL)
```

## Exercises
1. What are the 6 types of atomic vectors? How does a list differ from an atomic vector?  
**A**: raw, logical, integer, double, complex, character. A list can have elements of different types.

2. What makes `is.vector()` and `is.numeric()` fundamentally different from `is.list()` and `is.character()`?  
**A**: The first two do not check for specific types.

3. Test your knowledge of vector coercion rules by predicting the output of the following uses of `c()`:  
```
c(1, FALSE)      
c("a", 1)        
c(list(1), "a")  
c(TRUE, 1L)      
```
**A**: will be coerced to double, character, list with 2 elements of double and character, integer.
    ```{r}
    str(c(1, FALSE))      
    str(c("a", 1))        
    str(c(list(1), "a"))  
    str(c(TRUE, 1L))
    ```

4. Why do you need to use `unlist()` to convert a list to an atomic vector? Why doesn’t `as.vector()` work?  
**A**: A list is a vector.  
    ```{r, results='markup'}
    l <- list(1, list(2, 3))
    l
    is.vector(l)
    as.vector(l)
    unlist(l)
    ```

5. Why is `1 == "1"` true? Why is `-1 < FALSE` true? Why is `"one" < 2` false?  
**A**: `1` is coerced to `"1"`. `FALSE` is coerced to `0`. `2` is coerced to `"2"` - `“one”` comes after `“2”` in ASCII.

6. Why is the default missing value, `NA`, a logical vector? What’s special about logical vectors? (Hint: think about `c(FALSE, NA_character_)`.)  
**A**: A logical type can be coerced to any type.

## Attributes
All objects can have arbitrary additional attributes, used to store additional metadata. Attributes can be thought of as a (unique) named list. Attributes can be accessed individually with `attr()` or all at once with `attributes()`.

```{r}
a <- 1:3
attr(a, "x") <- "abcdef"
attr(a, "y") <- 4:6
attr(a, "z") <- list(list())
str(attributes(a))
```

```{r, out.width="200px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/attr.png")
```

The `structure()` function returns a new object with modified attributes.

```{r}
structure(1:10, my_attribute = "This is a vector")
```

By default, most attributes are lost when modifying a vector.

```{r, results='markup'}
attributes(a)
attributes(a[1])
attributes(sum(a))
```

The only attributes not lost are the three most important ones:

* Names

* Dimensions

* Class

Each of these attributes has a specific accessor function to get and set values, `names()`, `dim()`, and `class()`.

### Names
You can name a vector in 2 ways:

* When creating it: `x <- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)`.

* By modifying an existing vector:
    ```{r, results='hide'}
    x <- 1:3  
    names(x) <- c("a", "b", "c")
    x <- setNames(1:3, c("a", "b", "c"))
    ```

Names don’t have to be unique. However, character subsetting is the most important reason to use names and it is most useful when the names are unique.

Not all elements of a vector need to have a name. Depending on how you create the vector the missing names will either have value `""` or `NA_character_`. If all names are missing, `names()` will return `NULL`. You remove names from an existing vector using `unname(x)` or `names(x) <- NULL`.

### Factors
Attributes are used to define factors. A factor is a vector that can only contain predefined values, and is used to store categorical data. Factors are built upon integer vectors using two attributes:

* the `class`, "factor", which makes them behave differently from regular integer vectors, and

* the `levels`, which defines the set of allowed values.

```{r, results='markup'}
x <- factor(c("a", "b", "b", "a"))
x
typeof(x)
attributes(x)
```

```{r, out.width="200px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/factor.png")
```

Factors are useful when you know the possible values a variable may take, even if you don’t see all values in a given dataset. Using a factor instead of a character vector makes it obvious when some groups contain no observations:

```{r}
sex_char <- c("m", "m", "m")
table(sex_char)
```
```{r}
sex_factor <- factor(sex_char, levels = c("m", "f"))
table(sex_factor)
```

While factors look like (and often behave like) character vectors, they are actually integers. Be careful when treating them like strings. Some string methods (like `gsub()` and `grepl()`) will coerce factors to strings, while others (like `nchar()`) will throw an error, and still others (like `c()`) will use the underlying integer values. For this reason, it’s usually best to explicitly convert factors to character vectors if you need string-like behaviour.

```{r}
x <- factor(c("a", "b", "b", "a"))
x
as.character(x)
as.integer(x)
```

### Exercises
1. An early draft used this code to illustrate structure(): `structure(1:5, comment = "my attribute")`. But when you print that object you don’t see the comment attribute. Why?  
**A**: From the help of comment, `?comment`: the comment attribute is not printed. Also from the help of attributes `?attributes`: Note that some attributes (namely `class`, `comment`, `dim`, `dimnames`, `names`, `row.names` and `tsp`) are treated specially and have restrictions on the values which can be set.
    ```{r, results='markup'}
    x <- 1:3  
    comment(x) <- "Hello"
    x # comment is not printed to screen
    attributes(x)
    attributes(x[1]) # attribute is not retained
    ```

2. What happens to a factor when you modify its levels?  
    ```{r}
    f1 <- factor(letters)
    levels(f1) <- rev(levels(f1))
    ```
**A**: Both the entries and the levels are reversed.
    ```{r, results='markup'}
    f1 <- factor(letters)
    f1
    levels(f1) <- rev(levels(f1))
    f1
    f1[1] # levels are retained
    ```

3. What does this code do? How do `f2` and `f3` differ from `f1`?  
    ```{r, results='hide'}
    f2 <- rev(factor(letters))
    f3 <- factor(letters, levels = rev(letters))
    ```
**A**:
    ```{r, results='markup'}
    f2 # only entries are reversed
    f3 # only levels are reversed
    ```
    
Note that replacing the levels via `levels(x) <- value` is not the same as `attr(x, "levels") <- value`. For the `levels()` function, a `NA` in `value` causes that level to be removed from the levels.
```{r, results='markup'}
f1 <- factor(letters[1:3])
levels(f1) <- c("a", "b", NA)
f1
f2 <- factor(letters[1:3])
attr(f2, "levels") <- c("a", "b", NA)
f2
```
